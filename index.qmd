### Visualizing Duke's Student Body, from the 1920s to the 2020s.

This project is all about the students who shaped the development of Duke and transfused the campus with vitality throughout the last century. Since its origins as a one-room log schoolhouse, these students have been fundamental in keeping the institution alive, preserving its educational values and standards yet constantly pushing for greater ends. Today, Duke students continue to harness their ambition and appetite for inquiry to live out the bylaws of the University:

> *"to foster a lively relationship between knowledge and faith; to advance learning in all lines of truth; to defend scholarship against all false notions and ideals; to develop a love of freedom and truth; to promote a respectful spirit of dialogue and understanding; to discourage all partisan and sectarian strife; and to further the advancement of knowledge in service to society."*

I collected data on four aspects of student enrollment over time, namely gender distribution, class enrollment distribution, departmental distribution, and geographical distribution. Each of these four profiles can reveal much about the history of students at Duke and what external factors contributed to the changes that occurred.

As you click through the tabs and scroll through the pages, take a closer look at the numbers and visualizations that together, form a narrative of the generations of students that came before.

*A big thank you to the Duke University Archives and Professor Jacobs for assisting me in the collection of the data and the development of this project.*
