    "text": "Let’s examine the distributions of male and female undergraduate students at Duke University throughout the last century, using data on male and female students collected from the fall semesters for various years between 1929 and 2022. How have these distributions changed over time, and what has Duke done to facilitate these changes?\nWhen Duke University, then known as Trinity College, first opened in 1838, it was a small preparatory school for young men only. In a letter dated December 5, 1896, after Trinity College’s move to Durham, benefactor Washington Duke wrote to president John C. Kilgo pledging $100,000 to Trinity College for endowment provided the college “will open its doors to women placing them on an equal footing with men.” This act gained widespread acclaim and garnered increased support for womens’ rights and education.\nWhen the college opened in Durham in 1892, a vote by the Board of Trustees’ formally allowed women to enroll, but as day students only. There were four women enrolled then, and three of them were the daughters of faculty. These women were about to graduate at the time of Washington Duke’s gift, but the funds went to building a new womens’ dormitory, which dramatically increased interested in the school for female students. The new dormitory was proudly named Mary Duke Building, in honor of Washington Duke’s only daughter, Mary Duke.\nThe Woman’s College was established in 1930 with the completion of the construction of East Campus, while West Campus was home to the men’s Trinity College. Classes for women were held separately from those for men, and mostly on East Campus. Over time, interest in coeducation grew, and eventually, the two schools were merged in 1972.\n\n\n\nBaldwin Auditorium, originally named Woman’s College Auditorium, renamed after Dean Alice Baldwin in 1968.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The number of male and female undergraduate students from the years 1929 to 2022\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the scatterplot in Figure 1, we can clearly see the increase in enrollment for both undergraduate men and women over time; however, the rate of increase for women is greater than that for men. Due to gaps in raw data, there are periods of time in which the year-to-year changes are generalized, such as during the 1960s and 2000s. However, it is still apparent that there was a general upward trend.\nThe proportion of women undergraduate students today is greater than that of men, and that surpass occurred approximately around 2010. As of 2023, the undergraduate school is 48% male and 52% female. Although specific data is lacking for the years between 1998 and 2018, a New York Times article published in 2003 reported the figure of 43% of the undergraduate body being women, so until then, men still remained the majority.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The proportions of male and female undergraduate students from the years 1929 to 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  The percentages per year of undergraduate men and women \n \n  \n    Year \n    Men \n    Women \n    Percent Men \n    Percent Women \n  \n \n\n  \n    1929 \n    1640 \n    452 \n    78.39388 \n    21.60612 \n  \n  \n    1930 \n    1730 \n    575 \n    75.05423 \n    24.94577 \n  \n  \n    1931 \n    1930 \n    735 \n    72.42026 \n    27.57974 \n  \n  \n    1932 \n    1971 \n    784 \n    71.54265 \n    28.45735 \n  \n  \n    1933 \n    2036 \n    880 \n    69.82167 \n    30.17833 \n  \n  \n    1934 \n    2213 \n    946 \n    70.05381 \n    29.94619 \n  \n  \n    1936 \n    2307 \n    1016 \n    69.42522 \n    30.57478 \n  \n  \n    1937 \n    2293 \n    1034 \n    68.92095 \n    31.07905 \n  \n  \n    1938 \n    2389 \n    1084 \n    68.78779 \n    31.21221 \n  \n  \n    1939 \n    2508 \n    1122 \n    69.09091 \n    30.90909 \n  \n  \n    1940 \n    2536 \n    1147 \n    68.85691 \n    31.14309 \n  \n  \n    1941 \n    2388 \n    1181 \n    66.90950 \n    33.09050 \n  \n  \n    1942 \n    2283 \n    1260 \n    64.43692 \n    35.56308 \n  \n  \n    1948 \n    3718 \n    1396 \n    72.70239 \n    27.29761 \n  \n  \n    1949 \n    3699 \n    1386 \n    72.74336 \n    27.25664 \n  \n  \n    1950 \n    3535 \n    1377 \n    71.96661 \n    28.03339 \n  \n  \n    1951 \n    3251 \n    1380 \n    70.20082 \n    29.79918 \n  \n  \n    1952 \n    3195 \n    1339 \n    70.46758 \n    29.53242 \n  \n  \n    1967 \n    2865 \n    1658 \n    63.34291 \n    36.65709 \n  \n  \n    1968 \n    2897 \n    1745 \n    62.40844 \n    37.59156 \n  \n  \n    1969 \n    2918 \n    1763 \n    62.33711 \n    37.66289 \n  \n  \n    1970 \n    3004 \n    1830 \n    62.14315 \n    37.85685 \n  \n  \n    1971 \n    3110 \n    1956 \n    61.38966 \n    38.61034 \n  \n  \n    1972 \n    3214 \n    2117 \n    60.28888 \n    39.71112 \n  \n  \n    1973 \n    3157 \n    2152 \n    59.46506 \n    40.53494 \n  \n  \n    1974 \n    3157 \n    2273 \n    58.13996 \n    41.86004 \n  \n  \n    1975 \n    3133 \n    2347 \n    57.17153 \n    42.82847 \n  \n  \n    1976 \n    3121 \n    2558 \n    54.95686 \n    45.04314 \n  \n  \n    1977 \n    3136 \n    2666 \n    54.05033 \n    45.94967 \n  \n  \n    1978 \n    3236 \n    2852 \n    53.15375 \n    46.84625 \n  \n  \n    1979 \n    3241 \n    2835 \n    53.34101 \n    46.65899 \n  \n  \n    1980 \n    3215 \n    2852 \n    52.99159 \n    47.00841 \n  \n  \n    1981 \n    3300 \n    2878 \n    53.41534 \n    46.58466 \n  \n  \n    1982 \n    3290 \n    2863 \n    53.46985 \n    46.53015 \n  \n  \n    1983 \n    3262 \n    2964 \n    52.39319 \n    47.60681 \n  \n  \n    1984 \n    3300 \n    3061 \n    51.87864 \n    48.12136 \n  \n  \n    1985 \n    3309 \n    3053 \n    52.01195 \n    47.98805 \n  \n  \n    1986 \n    3481 \n    3044 \n    53.34866 \n    46.65134 \n  \n  \n    1987 \n    3531 \n    2892 \n    54.97431 \n    45.02569 \n  \n  \n    1988 \n    3585 \n    2820 \n    55.97190 \n    44.02810 \n  \n  \n    1989 \n    3589 \n    2792 \n    56.24510 \n    43.75490 \n  \n  \n    1990 \n    3603 \n    2873 \n    55.63620 \n    44.36380 \n  \n  \n    1991 \n    3521 \n    2933 \n    54.55531 \n    45.44469 \n  \n  \n    1992 \n    3520 \n    2995 \n    54.02916 \n    45.97084 \n  \n  \n    1993 \n    3538 \n    3048 \n    53.72001 \n    46.27999 \n  \n  \n    1994 \n    3436 \n    3082 \n    52.71556 \n    47.28444 \n  \n  \n    1995 \n    3447 \n    3184 \n    51.98311 \n    48.01689 \n  \n  \n    1996 \n    3428 \n    3324 \n    50.77014 \n    49.22986 \n  \n  \n    1997 \n    3434 \n    3332 \n    50.75377 \n    49.24623 \n  \n  \n    1998 \n    3493 \n    3341 \n    51.11209 \n    48.88791 \n  \n  \n    2018 \n    3485 \n    3590 \n    49.25795 \n    50.74205 \n  \n  \n    2019 \n    3468 \n    3618 \n    48.94157 \n    51.05843 \n  \n  \n    2020 \n    3262 \n    3346 \n    49.36441 \n    50.63559 \n  \n  \n    2021 \n    3363 \n    3589 \n    48.37457 \n    51.62543 \n  \n  \n    2022 \n    3330 \n    3686 \n    47.46294 \n    52.53706"

    "text": "Duke, being one of the most prestigious universities in the country, is renowned for its outstanding academics and extensive educational opportunities. In particular, Duke has quite the selection of courses and areas of study. As boasted by Duke’s Office of Undergraduate Admissions, the university offers 53 majors, 52 minors, and 23 certificates:\n\n“With the ability to create combinations of the three, you have 437,989 unique academic combinations available.”\n\nDuke’s selection of majors has undergone pretty drastic changes since its founding. On this page, we will look more closely at the departments over a span of 10 years, from 1933 to 1943. What changes were there in undergraduate student enrollment by department, and how do these numbers compare with the breakdown of majors today?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The number of students in each department from spring 1933 to spring 1943\n\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 1, we can see that the most popular subjects during this decade were Economics, English, History, Physical Education, Religion, and Romance Languages. For all of these, however, it seems enrollment seemed to peak around 1939-1940 and started to decrease. This may be just the beginning of the gradual shift towards the present-day distribution, as we can compare with Table 1. Most of the most popular majors now did not even exist back then.

    "text": "Today, students of Duke University hail from all 50 states and over 126 different countries. However, this was not always the case. At its very beginning, the school was a one-room log schoolhouse for local Methodists and Quakers in Randolph County, North Carolina. As it gradually expanded, students from nearby states started to enroll, and eventually they started coming from opposite coasts and across oceans. Let’s look at how the geographical distributions of the undergraduate body have changed each decade. Which states and countries does Duke accept the most students from?\n\n\n\nThe geographical distribution of undergraduate students in Trinity College and College of Engineering in fall of 1949\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The number of undergraduate students from each specified geographic region from the years 1929 to 1990\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the scale in Figure 1 makes it hard to see subtle differences between many states and countries, we can easily see which regions had significantly more students and which ones had significant increases over time. As expected, North Carolina was always higher than all others, and California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia all had pretty noticeable increases.\nNotes:\nCanal Zone refers to the historic administrative entity in Panama over which the United States exercised jurisdictional rights from 1903 to 1979. It was a strip of land 10 miles (16 km) wide along the Panama Canal, extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean and bisecting the Isthmus of Panama. The Canal Zone came into being on May 4, 1904 (“Acquisition Day”), under the terms of the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903, by which Panama granted to the United States, in return for annual payments, the sole right to operate and control the canal and about 5 miles (8 km) of land on each side.\nJava is an island of Indonesia the world’s most populous island, and is home to more than half of the country’s population.\nForeign and Territory became the terms used in the statistical records from 1970s and 1990s on, respectively, presumably due to the increase in foreign countries and regions around the world, making it more convenient to categorize them more broadly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    State \n    1929 \n    1930 \n    1940 \n    1950 \n    1970 \n    1980 \n    1990 \n  \n

    "text": "Today, Duke has a medium-sized undergraduate body, with about 6.8 thousand students. The last century has seen a significant increase in enrollment, and here we will break down these students by class to determine any changes or relations between the numbers. What do the proportions of each classes say about student enrollment and more importantly, student retention?\nCurrently, Duke has one of the highest freshman retention rates in the country, with about 98% of students returning for their sophomore year. This can be compared with the national average of 69% and the North Carolina average of 66%. As of 2017, Duke’s four-year graduation rate was around 95%, and six-year graduation rate has remained around 94%-96% for the last decade. Retention and graduation rates are important indicators of student achievement as they give insight on how many students are able to actually complete their degrees on time, and not simply enroll at the school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The number of undergraduate students in each class from the years 1929 to 1998\n\n\n\n\nTaking a look at Figure 1, we can snapshot the first and last years we have data on, and see what major changes have occurred. In 1929, the number of students decreased for each class from freshman to senior year. This indicates consistent drop-out rates each year. The 1970s-1990s saw many erratic changes, but by the end of the 1990s it appears there were more upperclassmen than underclassmen, presumably due to an increase in transfer students and gap year students. The trend of gradually decreasing numbers by class appears to have continued until the 1950s, in which the numbers seem to converge and started to vary once more in the 70s. It is worth noting that there are some significant gaps in the data, which make it hard to assess the validity of the trends during these few decades. However, we are able to still delineate the general pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The proportions of undergraduate students by class from the years 1929 to 1998\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 helps us visualize the changes in class proportions. We can see the increase in retention rates in the gradual evening-out of the four classes by the late 1990s. On the far left, the size of the freshman class far exceeded those of upper classes, some years coming close to making up 50% of the undergraduate body, but the classes even out significantly as we move towards the right.\nNote:\nThere were limitations in the collection of this data beyond just the missing years. The reports in the Duke Archives had only enrollment by semester, so the numbers used are from the fall semester reports each year. Additionally, the total enrollment each year is not an exact sum of the numbers recorded for each class, as I discounted the students recorded as “Special” or “Advanced Freshman”. However, these numbers were marginal and would not greatly effect the results."
